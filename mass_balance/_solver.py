    Solves the system of equations for a given isotherm.

    - It assumes constant A/O ration throughout the system.
    - It assumes that cationic exchange is the only mechanism of extraction inplace, otherwise charge constant is not valid.

    Note 1: Cells are enumerated from 0 to NÂº of cells - 1, so that 10 cells of extration are numbered from 0 to 9, \
        to conform with Python lists.
    Note 2: The charge balance equation requires that all given concentrations are in mol/L of the REE and not the REO.
    Note 3: Perhaps substituting list operations with numpy arrays might improve performance.
    Note 4: Don't add units in this solver as this might worsen the performance perhaps even at an order of magnitude level.
    Note 5: The results are given in-place, so be careful not to assign the results to a variable.
    Note 6: Implementation of models that considers the concentration of the extractant \
        should require the implementation of extractant mass balance equations.
